    <h2>About Me:</h2>

    <p>
        👩‍💻 Currently, I work as a Design Survey Associate for Dialectica. My daily journey involves crafting B2B surveys, diving into data with Excel, creating visualizations, and enhancing the user experience on our new platform.
    </p>

    <p>
        🎓 I earned my MSc in Managed Services with a specialization in Marketing from Athens University of Economics and Business in 2018. During my master's program, I delved into the "Effectiveness of two different promotional activities in the apparel industry" for my thesis, uncovering the power of emotional connections in purchase decisions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
          👩🏻‍💻As a Survey Design Associate I have also been involved in feature development for our B2B client portal. As my interest into product management grew, I completed the course from Boston University on "Product management with Lean, Agile and System Design Thinking" creating the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/MariannaNakou/new-product-alexaguard">Product Strategy</a> of an smart home security product.
    </p>

    <p>
        📊 Through my current role, I craft dashboards using Domo - DisplayR for consulting clients (Big4 & Big3), transforming survey data into valuable insights. I navigate the customer journey map with Hotjar and design client platforms with Figma.
    </p>

    <p>
        🧰 In previous roles, I've utilized Wix, MailChimp, and Wordpress to boost awareness and generate leads. For SADN, a youth club from the Dodecanese Islands, I used Canvas to create eye-catching event posters.
    </p>

    <p>
        🌿 Outside of the office, I embrace a holistic approach to wellness, indulge in swimming, share nutrition insights on <a href="https://mariannanakou93.medium.com/">Medium</a>, and advocate for animal rights and welfare.
